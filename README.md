<br> i'm not entirely sure about licenses and all that so please dont kill me if i stole your code 
<br> hopefully fanutils.py is "documented" well enough that you can make your own fan curves

usage<br>
all you need to do is do python3 loop.py and specify -on or -off flags
<br> i think -off is obsolete/useless because the fans automatically reset mode on keybaord interrupts but do it if you're paranoid i guess
