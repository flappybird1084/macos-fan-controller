<br> i'm not entirely sure about licenses and all that so please dont kill me if i stole your code 
<br> hopefully fanutils.py is "documented" well enough that you can make your own fan curves
<hr>
<br>usage<br>
all you need to do is do python3 loop.py and specify -on or -off flags
<br> i think -off is obsolete/useless because the fans automatically reset mode on keybaord interrupts but do it if you're paranoid i guess
<br> oh also quick note if you're on m1 or m2 you'll have to update the keys
<br> just go to exelban/stats /modules/readers/cpu and you'll find a readers file with a bunch of strings similar to that in fanutils.python3
<br> just sub those into the regex expression instead of what's already there. might just do this for you in a future release
